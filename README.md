# londons-dreadful-visitation
These XML files represent transcripts of the official weekly death statistics from the London plague outbreak of 1665, as published in 1666 in the book London's Dreadful Visitation. The data were entered by undergraduate students in Dr. William Campbell's World History to 1500 class in the fall semester of 2024. They have not been checked for accuracy. There are also some XQuery and XSLT files here that were used to run calculations and visualizations over the data.
One known error is that I collapsed "canker" and "cancer" into one category in the "Causes of death this week" section of the form. These should be separate, and the numbers will need to be re-entered.
If you are interested in using these data, please email me at whc 7 at pitt dot edu.
